Installation
============

If you want to use Serenity as a library in your own projects you can install the latest version
from PyPi with pip as follows::

    $ pip install serenity-trading

But most likely you want to run backtests or even live trading strategies, which requires more
extensive installation process. You will want to clone the code locally for this::

    $ git clone https://github.com/cloudwall/serenity.git

then you'll need to install a (Postgres-based) database and (optionally) cloud-enable your
install with Kubernetes, as covered below.

Database install
----------------

First, install `TimescaleDB <http://timescale.com/>`_ on your local machine.

Next, load the following files:

* ``sql/serenitydb_install.sql``
* ``sql/serenitydb_schema.sql``
* ``sql/serenitydb_grants.sql``

Be sure to change the passwords in ``serenitydb_install.sql`` and ``sharadar_schema.sql``!

Refdata install
---------------

Once you have the database installed you should sync product refdata by running
``serenity/db/install_instruments.py``. This script requires the following environment
variables to be set matching your database install:

* ``TIMESCALEDB_NODEPORT_SERVICE_HOST``
* ``TIMESCALEDB_NODEPORT_SERVICE_PORT``
* ``POSTGRES_SERENITY_PASSWORD``

Note if you're running TimescaleDB on ``localhost:5432`` you only need to set the last environment variable.

Kubernetes install
------------------

I highly recommend the `microk8s <https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-a-local-kubernetes-with-microk8s#1-overview>`_
distribution that comes with Ubuntu, but you should be able to use any Kubernetes installation
with the YAML files that come under the ``kubernetes`` directory. Each file can be installed with::

    $ microk8s.kubectl apply -f $FILE

but you may need to customize them to meet your local needs. One to watch out for:
``database-secret-config.yaml``. You'll need to replace the passwords for postgres,
serenity and sharadar with the base64-encoded versions of the actual passwords
instead of ``********``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    data:
        postgres-password: "********"
        serenity-password: "********"
        sharadar-password: "********"

You can generate an encoded password as follows -- not the "-n" argument is critical::

    $ echo -n $PASSWORD | base64
