Developer Days
==============

Developer days are mini-hackathons and getting-started sessions for developers and
quant researchers interested in Serenity. They are ideal for those interested in
:doc:`contributing` or using Serenity for writing trading strategies. Note that the
Zoom sessions will be recorded and published after the Developer Day so others can
benefit if unable to attend.

Preparing
---------
* Fork the code on GitHub: https://github.com/cloudwall/serenity
* Install Serenity: :doc:`install`
* Read the quickstart guide: :doc:`quickstart`
* Prepare questions

Joining
-------
If you want to join a developer day you should first reach out to get the Zoom
password and a Slack channel invite. Send a PM to Kyle on LinkedIn or email if
interested to sign up, and be sure to introduce yourself and your areas of interest.
