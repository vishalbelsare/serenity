Serenity is a Python 3.x-based, open source trading system. It supports both tick-by-tick style reactive programming
and a more traditional strategy authoring approach that's more oriented toward investment strategies with longer time
horizons. At this time only cryptocurrency exchanges and marketdata are supported.
